1. Create an abstract class called Customer with:
	- Four properties, name, balance, cart (String), cartCost
	
	- An all-args constructor used for constructor chaining
	
	- A public method called addToCart which takes a item as a string, and a cost
	  as an int, and adds the item to the cart and cost to the cartCost, returns the
	  updated cart
	  
	- A public abstract method called buy
	
2. Create an interface called Premium with:
	- A String property title set to the title of the user
	
	- An int method called discountPrice which takes in an int
	
3. Create a class called PremiumCustomer that:
	- extends Customer, and implements Premium
	
	- has private properties vipCard which is their card number, a integer years
	  which keeps track of the number of years they have been vip
	
	- The PremiumCustomer should have a no-args constructor, and an all args
	  constructor that allows you to set the properties of the Customer class,
	  and the properties of the PremiumCustomer
	  
	- implement the abstract methods so that the premium user gets a discount
	  of 15% on all items in their cart, and the discounted cost gets deducted
	  from their balance
	  
	- implement the getters and setters for the premium user
